[200~For starters, I definately want to keep getting better with my keyboard shortcuts! This is something I'd given up on for a while but it's ABSOLUTELY faster than grabbing for a mouse, and I think being able to efficiently navigate this environment is going to be key in this program! Second, after taking the time tonight it's absolutely worthwhile staying up and doing some review (or in this case, the homework itself which has a decent bit of review) immediately after class. Or, I mean... I might edit that in the morning


HUGE shout-out to my family for supporting me while I transition into this program! Ive been stressing about it big time, and these guys have been there every step of the way to remind me Im worrying too much!
