[200~For starters, I definately want to keep getting better with my keyboard shortcuts! This is something I'd given up on for a while but it's ABSOLUTELY faster than grabbing for a mouse, and I think being able to efficiently navigate this environment is going to be key in this program! Second, after taking the time tonight it's absolutely worthwhile staying up and doing some review (or in this case, the homework itself which has a decent bit of review) immediately after class. Or, I mean... I might edit that in the morning


HUGE shout-out to my family for supporting me while I transition into this program! Ive been stressing about it big time, and these guys have been there every step of the way to remind me Im worrying too much!


Not everything from these first two lessons is completely new to me, but ther are nonehtless some important points I want to take away. For starters, I am a stubborn person. I will bang my head against a wall until I keel over trying to go it alone if I let myself, and that's self-destructive in more ways that I would have considered. Asking for help is (1) going to make my life a whole lot easier for having some access to the class's collective knowledge and skills, and (2) is going to add to the overall conversation and collective knowledge in ways that OTHER people might find helpful, too. I often think of asking for help as a selfish thing, but especially in this context it really isn't. 

It's also really quite empowering to hear someone else finally embrace that einstein dogma of never memorize something you can look up. I have embraced that philosophy for a long time, and I feel like sometimes that's looked down upon in other professions (like educationeven though it DOES make sense. I'm glad that the coding world embraces google culture! 

I'm also going to go ahead and peg frequent, small commits as a more important takeaway than I'm realizing. That first reading made it seem like big unweildy commits are a bad idea and... actually, I can see why that would be terrible from a collaboration perspective. Or from a record-keeping perspective.
